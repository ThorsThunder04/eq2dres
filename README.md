# eq2dres
This program solves second degree equations.

the polynom: ``ax^2 + bx + c``

What the program will do:
-First you enter a, b, c from the polynom you would like to be solved.
-It will then output the discrimnient (Delta), Alpha and Beta.
-Then depending on the result of Delta, it print x1 and x2 if ``Delta > 0``, x0 if ``Delta = 0`` and no result if ``Delta < 0``.

The program will output the results in simplified fraction form if needed. So you will not recieve for example ``0.3333333333333`` as an answer, you will instead get ``1/3``. 
Or, instead of it giving you ``14/24``, it will give you ``7/12``.
